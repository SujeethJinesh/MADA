This is a doc for me to just jot down random notes

Taken from README

1) To install dependencies and stuff.

```
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv; source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install -g webpack; npm install
```

2) Webpack is complicated. If you have trouble loading some types of files, check webpack. You need to use a specific type of loader

Example:

module: {
    loaders: [
      {
      test: /\.svg$/,
      loader: "file-loader"
      }

This is for loading any .svg files

3) use `python3 app.py` to run the local server

4) use `webpack --watch` to watch files you are changing and see errors.

5) in order to start debugging in webpack, add this to webpack. then look at the sources in the website. There will be a webpack folder and a . folder

```
  debug: true,
  devtool: "#eval-source-map",
```

6) can run app (with dev option) with `python3 app.py -dev`

7) To auto upload in pycharm to dev server:
    a) cmd + ,
    b) build, execution, deployment
    c) deployment
    d) May wanna change the root path depending on what you wanna do (/var/www/<your project>)

8) To do server stuff with apache --> https://pythonprogramming.net/creating-first-flask-web-app/
